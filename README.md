# Six-Degrees-of-Kevin-Bacon
 This Python project explores the concept of connecting actors in the Hollywood film industry through a series of movies, inspired by the popular game "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon." The program uses various search algorithms, including DFS, BFS, UCS, and Dijkstra's Algorithm, to find the shortest path between any two actors.
